# user-templates-api
This repository handles templates for the [workspaces feature](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/workspaces) in the HuBMAP Data Portal. Templates are pre-set notebooks with analyses that can be added to a workspace. Variables linked to a workspace (such as the datasets added to the workspace) can be added into the templates.


## Contributing
We welcome contributions! Please see our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/user-templates-api/blob/development/CONTRIBUTING.md). For adding new templates, please see our [template contributing guidelines](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/user-templates-api/blob/development/src/user_templates_api/templates/jupyter_lab/templates/new_template/README.md).
